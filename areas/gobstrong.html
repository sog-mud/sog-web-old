You step into a cavern chiseled from solid granite. The first thing
you notice is the stench. You see goblins everywhere, clad for battle.
Perhaps they are training for an assault on Midgaard, as they have been
spotted outside the South Gate more and more frequently. Whatever their
purpose here, you must put a stop to it. You see a hallways leading east
and west, and a set of great doors to the south.<BR>
   There is a small (Glowing) (Huming) tablet.
