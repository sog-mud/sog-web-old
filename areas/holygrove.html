You are standing at the entrace of a beautiful grove of trees, and your
heart is filled with pure, peaceful thoughts.  This looks like a safe place
to recover from the wounds of adventuring.  A faint path through the grove
lies to the north, and you can see the eastern road to the south.
-->
You are standing amidst the ancient oaks and poplars in the holy grove. You
feel calm and relaxed here, as if great burdens have been lifted from Your
shoulders. From here, pleasant-looking paths lead east, north and south. To
the west, through the trees, You can see a faint trail leading towards the
eastern road.
