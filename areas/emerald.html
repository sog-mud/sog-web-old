All the lingering beauty of these green woods conspire to charm you into
staying here forever.  Woodlarks are singing high in the boughs of trees
while shafts of sunlight turn the forest floor into a carpet of gold and
green.  The woodland trails running through this area of the forest seem
well-kept, yet untravelled.
