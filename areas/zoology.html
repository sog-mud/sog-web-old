 You are standing right inside the entrance to the museum.  Wow, this is
going to be such fun!  You quickly evade your MudSchool teacher and go off
on your own.  To the north you see the entrance to the mud museum, while
upstairs you see a souviniere shop.  To the south is the Hall of the Beefed
up Tinsy Animals, while to the west is the Wide World of Chordates.  Finally
to the east you see the special marine section of the museum.  
-->
The museum has this great new exhibit that you've been dying to see 
and now is your chance! Through these doors is a great new exhibit about 
the evolution of life as we know it.  You're so excited you think you're 
about to wet your armor! So just head right on in to the south.
