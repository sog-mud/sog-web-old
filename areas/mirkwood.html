Entrance to Mirkwood<BR>
  You have entered the quasi-magical Elven forest of Mirkwood, populated by
Sylvan Elves and their mysterious allies. Strangers are frowned upon here,
so be on your guard. It is rumored that many different races of Elves actually 
inhabit this forest, in various parts and sometimes they are carefully hidden, 
away from the prying eyes of strangers.
There is a sign tacked to a tree nearby.<BR>
     There is a small (Glowing) (Huming) tablet.
