<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Muddy MUD Realms</H1>

<P ALIGN=FUSTIFY>
Muddy MUD project was started on April 1998.
Muddy is based in Anatolia 2.1b2 code.
The main project goal is multilanguage support.
Currently english and russian languages are supported.
Support for other languages can be easily added.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
At this time we have areas and message multilanguage support,
color code (by Lope), automatic quest code (almost completely rewritten),
many bugfixes and internal enhancements, ROM OLC code 1.71 merged
(almost completely rewritten and enhanced).
We plan to merge some code from SMAUG.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The main developing platform for Muddy is FreeBSD, so you
should not have any troubles building Muddy under FreeBSD.
At the early stage ports to SunOS 5.x and Unixware 2.x were made
but for now these ports may be broken (signal processing is still BSD-style)
and I do not want to patch those parts of code though it is not hard --
I do not have enough time and interest (fjoe).
Some people have reported that they have compiled Muddy on Linux successfully
but the problem is in System V semantics for signals under Linux.
We have a port of Muddy to win32 (it is in main CVS tree now).
The author of this port is <a href="mailto:tyunaev@usa.net">Tim Yunaev</a>.
Please send all your questions about win32 port to him.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>We put Muddy sources on Anonymous CVS.
You can also access Muddy via <A HREF="http://iclub.nsu.ru/cgi-bin/cvsweb/muddy/">cvsweb</A>.
