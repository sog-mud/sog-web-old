<P ALIGN=FUSTIFY>
Muddy MUD project was started on April 1998.
Muddy is based in Anatolia 2.1b2 code.
The main project goal is multilanguage support.
Currently english and russian languages are supported.
Support for other languages can be easily added.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
At this time we have areas and message multilanguage support,
color code (by Lope), automatic quest code (almost completely rewritten),
many bugfixes and internal enhancements, ROM OLC code 1.71 merged
(almost completely rewritten and enhanced).
We plan to merge some code from SMAUG.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The main developing platform for Muddy is FreeBSD, so you
should not have any troubles building Muddy under FreeBSD.
Muddy is known to compile under Linux successfully.
At the early stage ports to SunOS 5.x and Unixware 2.x were made
but for now these ports may be (and I'm sure they are :) broken.
But there should not be any problems compiling Muddy there -- all
missing functions are in compat/ (strsep, [v]snprintf etc.)
We have a port of Muddy to win32 (it is in main CVS tree now).
The author of this port is <a href="mailto:tyunaev@usa.net">Tim Yunaev</a>.
Please send all your questions about win32 port to him.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>We put Muddy sources on Anonymous CVS.
You can also access Muddy via <A HREF="http://cs.nstu.ru/cgi-bin/cvsweb/sog/">cvsweb</A>.
