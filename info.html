<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Shades of Gray</H1>

<P ALIGN=FUSTIFY>
SoG project was started on April 1998.
SoG is based in Anatolia 2.1b2 code.
The main project goal is multilanguage support.
Currently english and russian languages are supported.
Support for other languages can be easily added.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
At this time we have multilanguage support (with automatic
grammatic word forms creation),
color code (by Lope), automatic quest code (almost completely rewritten),
challenge quests, skill affects,
many bugfixes and internal enhancements, ROM OLC code 1.71 merged
(almost completely rewritten and enhanced).
We also have moved almost all the static tables to configuration files
and have an ability to reload spellfuns, dofuns and OLC code
dynamically. We removed almost all the hardcoded CLAN_XXX, CLASS_XXX
and RACE_XXX constants from the code so SoG should be
a pretty good codebase.
We plan to merge some code from SMAUG.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The main development platform for SoG is FreeBSD, so you
should not have any troubles building SoG under FreeBSD.
SoG is known to compile under Linux successfully.
At the early stage ports to SunOS 5.x and Unixware 2.x were made
but for now these ports may be (and I'm sure they are :) broken.
But there should not be any problems compiling SoG there -- all
missing functions are in compat/ (strsep, [v]snprintf etc.)
We have a port of SoG to win32 (it is in main CVS tree now).
The author of this port is <a href="mailto:tyunaev@usa.net">Tim Yunaev</a>.
Please send all your questions about win32 port to him.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Please note that some Linux distributions (e.g.: RedHat 5.x) have broken ld.so
which may cause troubles with our dynamically loaded modules.
Please update ld.so if you have any troubles.
FreeBSD also had this problem but it was fixed in both 4.0-current
and 3.0-stable branches (by me :) somewhere in the Jul 1999.
