<P>
These are the rules of the Shades of Gray. Disobeying is grounds
for deletion. For other matters, use common sense.
</P>
<OL>
<LI> Remember that this is a roleplaying atmosphere. If an immortal imposes
     their will upon you, you must do it. Do not ask a wizi-invis god 'who they
     are'. This is question is considered rude and will not be answered.

<LI> Immortals often make announcements via notes, and you are required to 
     follow accordingly. Not having read the notes is no excuse. It is the 
     same as if the Immortal told you in person.

<LI> Player stealing and killing is permitted and encouraged.

<LI> Do not use charmed pets to PK people who are out of your PK range.
     If a person is not in your pk range, and they do not initiate an attack on
     your group member, then your pets had better not touch them.

<LI> Your presence here is a privilege not a right.  Obey any orders from gods,
     and you will be fine.  

<LI> MULTICHARRING: You may have more than one character, but you may not use
     multiple logins from same terminal. Punishment for this rule is
     deleting of one char.

<LI> Anyone who assists people in multicharing, i.e. holding equipment while
     they transfer it, 'looking the other way', etc will be punished harshly.

<LI> DO NOT, in any way, shape or form, exploit bugs. It WILL result in a
     punishment determined by IMPLEMENTORS. Repeat DO NOT exploit bugs, you 
     WILL be IMMEDIATELY punished.

<LI> SPAMMING IS ILLEGAL. (Spam filling up someone's screen with needless 
     repetion of anything) You will be given one warning and then deleted.
     Don't do it.

<LI> Sexual harrassment will not be tolerated.  If both parties do not consent
     to the socials/emotes, then don't do them.

<LI> Cheating will not be tolerated. This includes accepting favors from
     gods and exploiting bugs.
</OL>

<P>  
  These are simple, clear rules. If you violate them you WILL be
  punished. Punishments may vary, depending on previous rules violations, 
  the situation. Be prepared for the worst if you are caught breaking 
  these rules.
</P>
<P>
  Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and
  may be done withoutwarning, notice, or even evidence of sanity.
