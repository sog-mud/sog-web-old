<P>
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,
both in body and mind.
</P><P>
Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the
use of iron in their adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously
hard to spot and walk unnoticed automatically. They may see in the dark
with infravision.  Elves must stay good to cast any spells they know.
Elves who have turned to evil are frowned upon.
