Storm giants are the largest of the giant races, ranging from 12-20 feet in 
height.  They are strong, and almost as durable as the dwarves. They aren't 
too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy than the 
other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are
ill-suited for any other profession.
<P>
Storm giants resist lightning, can fly.  However, they are the most clever 
of giants. Storm giants, due to their  size and stamina, receive the fast 
healing and bash skills for free. Cloud giants have weapon resistance.
