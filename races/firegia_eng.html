Fire giants are the large, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They are 
strong, and almost as durable as the dwarves. They aren't too bright, 
however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy than the 
other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are
ill-suited for any other profession.
</P><P>
Fire giants resist fire .  However, their slow minds make them extremely 
vulnerable to mental attacks.  Storm giants, due to their  size and 
stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for free. Cloud giants  
have weapon resistance.
