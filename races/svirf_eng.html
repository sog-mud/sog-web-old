The Svirfnebli, also known as deep gnomes, have made their way into Muddy as
the paths to the Underdark have been found.  Slighty larger than their 
surface cousins, these gnomes are also stronger and a little more hearty from
centuries of working stone.  The dedication to stone has made them not  
quite as adept mentally as their cousins, but yet they are still regarded 
as very wise.  With their singular dedication to the stone, svirfnebli 
must be neutral in all  aspects of their lives.  They have the same ability 
in learning the powers of items as their surface cousins.
