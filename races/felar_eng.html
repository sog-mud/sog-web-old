The Felar are a race descended from the great cats. For long years in their
past, the Felar were enslaved by wizards to serve as familiars.  The scars
of this servitude still show in the relative weakness and dull wits of the
Felar.  They are renowned, however, for their agility and their "nine lives".
It is said a Felar can withstand blows in battle (or from an angry master)
that would kill a human outright.
<P>
The thick fur of the Felar makes them resistent to cold, but also very
vulnerable to fire.  They also abhor water and are liable to drown in it.
Despite heavy modification by their former masters, the Felar retain the
large claws and fangs of their ancestors.  This gives them the ability to
inflict extra damage during a fight, but the claws are not retractable so
it is difficult for a Felar to walk unnoticed.  The Felar are also famed for
their street fighting ability.  The Felar do not have the discipline or wits
to be pure magic-users, and some of the Felar still resent the mages, anyway.
The wars of freedom were long ago, however, so many younger Felar are willing
to forgive and forget, and some have even begun to dabble in the magic that
once imprisoned them.
