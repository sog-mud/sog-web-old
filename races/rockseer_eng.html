Rockseers are a race of renegade elves who lives underworld in rock caves.
They are inherently intelligent but have neglected intellectualstudies 
and become very translucent from years of generations of trying to pass 
rocks.  Like elves, rockseers have infravision and can walk innocent and
can pass doors easily.Rockseers must stay neutral to cast any spells they 
might know. And because of their organism they are vulnerable to woods.
They have a specific spell called 'meld into stone'.
