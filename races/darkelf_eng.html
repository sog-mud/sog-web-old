Dark-elves are a race of renegade elves who have turned their energy toward
evil.  They are inherently intelligent but have neglected intellectual
studies and become very nimble from years of generations of thievery and
mischief.  Like elves, dark-elves have infravision and can walk unnoticed.
Dark elves must stay evil to cast any spells they might know.  Those who
turn to good are frowned upon.  Dark-Elves are burned by the touch of
mithril.
