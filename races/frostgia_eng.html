Frost giants are the largest of the giant races, ranging from 9-12 feet in 
height.  They are strong, and almost as durable as the dwarves. They aren't 
too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy than the 
other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are
ill-suited for any other profession.
<P>
Frost giants resist cold.  However, their slow minds make  them extremely 
vulnerable to mental attacks.  Storm giants, due to their  size and 
stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for free.And they are
born to be enemies of white dragons.
