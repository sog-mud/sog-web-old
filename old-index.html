<h1 align=center>Muddy MUD Realms</h1>

<p align=justify>
Muddy MUD project was started on April 1998.
Muddy is based in Anatolia 2.1b2 code.
The main project goal is multilanguage support.
Currently english and russian languages are supported.
Support for other languages can be easily added.

<p align=justify>
At this time we have message multilanguage support, color code (by Lope),
automatic quest code (almost completely rewritten),
many bugfixes and internal enhancements, ROM OLC code 1.71 merged.
We plan to merge some code from SMAUG.

<p align=justify>We put muddy sources on Anonymous CVS.
You can also access muddy via <a href="http://iclub.nsu.ru/cgi-bin/cvsweb/muddy/">cvsweb</a>.
